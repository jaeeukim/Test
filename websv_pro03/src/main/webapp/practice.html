	<h1>Date and time formats used in HTML</h1>
	
	<section>
	Certain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats 
	of the strings that specify these values are described in 
	this article. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Elements that use such formats include certain forms of the 
	<a href="">&lt;input&gt;</a> element that let the user choose or specify a 
	date, time, or both, as well as the <a href="">&lt;ins&gt;</a> and <a href="">&lt;del&gt;</a> elements, whose 
	<a href="">datetime</a> attribute specifies the date or date and time at which the insertion or deletion of content occurred.
	<br>
	<br>
	For &lt;input&gt;, the values of <a href="">type</a> that return
	 a <a href="">value</a> which contains a string representing a date and/or time are:
	</section>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href=""> date </a></li>
		<li><a href=""> datetime-local </a></li>
		<li><a href=""> month </a></li>
		<li><a href=""> time </a></li>
		<li><a href=""> week </a></li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<h2><a href="">Examples</a></h2>
	Before getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are 
	written and parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give 
	you a good idea what the more commonly-used date and time string 
	formats look like.
	<br>
	<br>
	<table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse">
		<caption>Example HTML date and time strings</caption>

			<td>String</td>
			<td colspan="2">Date and/or time</td>

	<h2><a href="">Basics</a></h2>
	Before looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML 
	elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're 
	defined. HTML uses a variation of the <a href="">ISO 8601</a> standard for its date and time 
	strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to 
	ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification 
	includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 
	8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to 
	look.
	
	<br>
	<h3><a href="">Character set</a></h3>
	Dates and times in HTML are always strings which use the <a href="">ASCII</a> character set.
	<br>
	<h3><a href="">Year numbers</a></h3>
	In order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification 
	requires that all years be given using the modern (or proleptic) <a href="">Gregorian calendar</a>. 
	While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying 
	value always uses the Gregorian calendar.
	<br><br>
	While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.
	<br><br>
	For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes ("0"), so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.
	<br><br>
	A year is normally 365 days long, except during <a href="">leap years</a>.
